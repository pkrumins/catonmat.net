      I'm sorry, the page you were looking for was not found.

    <h2>How did that happen?</h2>
    <p>I am not exactly sure why the page you were looking for was not found. There are several possible reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Someone sent you a broken link,</li>
      <li>It's my mistake, I haven't set up the page properly,</li>
      <li>You made a mistake when typing the address.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I am going to do about it?</h2>
    <p>My goal is to provide the best user-experience to my website visitors. Therefore this event of page not being found <strong>has been logged to database</strong> for further investigation. I wrote code that displays me the summary of all the pages that were not found. I often correct the non-existing page requests and redirect them to existing pages so that visitors are satisfied.</p>


    <h2>Meanwhile...</h2>
    <p>Meanwhile, while I investigate and fix this mistake, you can <strong>view my most popular posts</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
    % for page in top_pages:
     <li><a href="${page.request_path}" title="Read &quot;${page.title}&quot; (has been read ${page.us_views} times)">${page.title|h}</a></li>
    % endfor
    </ul>

    <p>Or, you can <strong>view my most recent posts</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
    % for page in recent_pages:
     <li><a href="${page.request_path}" title="Read &quot;${page.title}&quot; (was published on ${page.publish_time})">${page.title|h}</a></li>
    % endfor
    </ul>

    <h2>Thank you!</h2>
    <p>Thank you for understanding!</p>
    <p>
      Sincerely,<br>
